## State machine
1. **Get route:** The route to reach the next point on the route is obtained.
2. **Going to point:** This state is divided into 2 parts; first, the robot aligns itself with the next target point of the route, and then it advances to this point.
3. **Align orientation:** Align the final orientation of the route.

## Ompl
For the planning development, OMPL was used. Initially, the code provided in the practice statement was employed, and it was broken down step by step, adapting it to our application. This development was carried out locally.

### Space
We still have a 2-dimensional space, so we will continue using it.**space = ob.SE2StateSpace()** However, we will change the boundaries of the image to its width and height.

### Validity checker
To check if a state is valid, we will have the map in binary format describing obstacles and non-obstacles, rather than simply relying on the value of the robot's position on the map.

In the initial implementation, after applying an erosion operation to the image to enhance obstacles, the robot was considered as a point. Subsequently, it was implemented that this validation would be done by approximating a square to the robot, creating a method that allows changing the size of this 'bounding box' so that, once the shelf is lifted, the robot simulates having its dimensions.

### Planner
First, we implemente **RRTConnect** but in the [documentation](https://ompl.kavrakilab.org/namespaceompl_1_1geometric.html) we found other planners; in addition to the ones provided in the statement, the following were tested:

An aspect I would like to highlight is the optimization of these algorithms. As shown in the last image, if they are not properly optimized, they will mark too many intermediate points.

The one that yielded better initial results was PRM, but after further investigation and several tests, but finally, a more accurate algorithm was found. A summary of some algorithms that were studied:

1. PRMstar (Probabilistic RoadMap):
- **Steps:**
  - Sample configurations and build a roadmap graph.
  - Apply a graph search algorithm for an optimal path.
- **Features:**
  - Probabilistically complete.
  - Emphasis on roadmap creation.

2. FMT (Asymptotically Optimal Fast Marching Tree):
- **Steps:**
  - Build a tree using a fast marching method for efficient exploration.
  - Optimize the tree by pruning and rewiring.
- **Features:**
  - Asymptotically optimal.
  - Combines fast marching with optimization.

3. InformedRRTstar:
- **Steps:**
  - Use heuristics to bias sampling towards the goal region.
  - Grow the tree using RRTstar principles with heuristic guidance.
- **Features:**
  - Heuristic-guided exploration.
  - Integration of RRTstar with informed sampling.

4. RRTstar (Optimal RRT):
- **Steps:**
  - Randomly sample and extend the tree towards sampled points.
  - Optimize the tree by rewiring connections for improved path cost.
- **Features:**
  - Biased exploration for efficiency.
  - Finds near-optimal solutions.

5. PRM (Probabilistic RoadMap):
- **Steps:**
  - Sample configurations and build a roadmap graph.
  - Apply a graph search algorithm for a solution.
- **Features:**
  - Probabilistically complete.
  - Versatile for various environments.


### Resolution
The same steps are followed to solve the problem; the option of researching was also explored. [planner.solve](https://ompl.kavrakilab.org/namespaceompl_1_1base.html#a5c218cde462780a4502dfc561708e903)

## Map Acquisition
Initially, the map acquisition was done as in previous practices, but there was an issue with conflicts between cv2 and matplotlib. Therefore, the decision was made to obtain the image through PIL, as we do not need to perform many vision operations for this application. Additionally, the image is binarized since we only need to know if there is an obstacle or not.

For the first implementation, the image was eroded to give more weight to the obstacles. Later, this erosion was removed to use the planner only with the robot's geometry.

Another important aspect regarding the map was that when lifting a shelf, it was necessary to update it so that it did not consider the legs once the shelf was lifted, and at the same time, it would draw the legs once the shelf is placed on the ground.

## 2D to 3D
For the conversion from 2D to 3D, a linear regression was performed, similar to what was done in Practice 1.

## Robot geometry
In the first implementation, we treated the vacuum cleaner as a point. However, the idea is for the map to take into account the robot's geometric shape instead of widening the walls. This can be achieved by modifying the valid spaces function of the robot. We can approximate the robot to a square to avoid collisions. The problem arises when the robot carries the shelf since its shape becomes rectangular.

Given that the robot is square, the most optimal approach could be to approximate it to a circle, as it would significantly optimize the computational process, and we would lose little space. However, for the shelf, this wouldn't be applicable since it is rectangular, and we would lose a considerable amount of space. Finally, the decision was made to use a square-shaped vacuum cleaner for code simplicity.

## Movement 
The approach-to-waypoint process was implemented by adding two phases. The first phase involves aligning the robot with the next point, which operates using a PID controller. Subsequently, there is a forward movement towards the point, with a continuous forward speed as it yielded good results.

## Final result

* In the next [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdVCC88b00k) podemos ver como el robot al principio asegura la ruta, pero luego al levantar va recto directamente, esto se ve mejor en la segunda estantería donde se puede apreciar que al quitar la estantería del mapa, se puede ver como pasa por un punto e el cual al principio no podría pasar pero con el mapa actualizado puede sin problema.
